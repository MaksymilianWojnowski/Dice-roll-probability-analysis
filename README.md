# Dice Roll Probability Analyzer

## Description
This Python script generates a graphical representation of the probability distribution for the sum of rolling a specified number of six-sided dice. It utilizes the Tkinter library for GUI and Matplotlib for plotting.

## How to Use
1. Run the Python script `dice_roll_probability.py`.
2. A window titled "Dice Roll Probability" will appear.
3. Enter the desired number of dice to roll when prompted.
4. The script will display a bar chart showing the probability distribution of the sum of the dice rolls.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter
- Matplotlib

## How It Works
- The script prompts the user to input the number of dice to roll.
- It then calculates all possible outcomes of rolling the specified number of six-sided dice.
- The probabilities of each sum are computed and plotted using Matplotlib.
- The resulting bar chart is displayed within the Tkinter GUI window.

## Notes
- The user can specify any number of dice between 1 and 10.
- The probability percentages displayed on top of each bar indicate the likelihood of obtaining the corresponding sum.
